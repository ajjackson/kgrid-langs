# kgrid-langs

A programming project for ajjackson.  The aim is to produce a program
with similar functionality to https://github.com/wmd-group/kgrid in a
range of programming languages, in order to get a sense of the
available options for routine scientific computing. Features to be
used, exploiting standard/mainstream library routines where possible,
include:

* Calculations on vectors/matrices
* Command-line arguments and help 
* File input and recognition
* Write to standard output

Speed is not the main target, as the amount of computation involved in
this test is very small, but the languages chosen were selected for
their potential to outperform Python+Numpy for common tasks.
